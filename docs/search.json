This is a task that forms part of the ongoing European project Safeguarding European wild pollinators (Safeguard).

The metaweb in its current form has obvious biases (e.g., spatial) that we hope to overcome with the addition of new studies. This metaweb takes into consideration insect pollinators and the flowering plants they visit. Specifically, the metaweb focus only on the most relevant and representative entomophilous taxa found across networks: bees, syrphids, bombylids, butterflies and pollinating beetles. Currently, we are in the process of reviewing and homogenising pollinator and plant species names.\n\n\n\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.
