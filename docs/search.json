    "text": "Here, we present a joint effort to build the first European metaweb of plant-pollinator interactions. This is a task that forms part of the ongoing European project Safeguarding European wild pollinators (Safeguard). At the moment, this metaweb comprises 38 different studies distributed across 13 countries with a total of 1152 individual study sites or networks (Figure 1).\nThe main goal of this metaweb is to be a dynamic project where the addition of studies would help to validate the robustness of our understanding of plant-pollinator interactions at the European level. The metaweb in its current form has obvious biases (e.g., spatial) that we hope to overcome with the addition of new studies. This metaweb is going to consider exclusively insect pollinators and plants that they visit. In particular the metaweb would account for bees, syrphids, bombylids, butterflies and pollinating beetles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.
