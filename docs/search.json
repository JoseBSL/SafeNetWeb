All plant species where sampled\nfor equal time period. All floral visitors were collected.\nWe determined the total number of flowers or inflorescences (fower units)\nper plant species in 1-m2 areas located at 1-m intervals along the two 50 m transects.\nFlower unit description is defined as the distance that a small bee (c. 1 cm length)\nwould fly, rather than walk (Saville 1993). For example, in the Asteraceae, a flower\nunit is the entire inflorescence while in the Rosaceae, a flower unit is a single flower.\nNetworks where only sampled April to June for Carpobrotus and June/July for Opuntia,\nSites are invaded or non invaded, and 50*50m; situated at least 300 m apart. \n  \n  \n    1_Bartomeus \n    Taxa_recorded \n    All floral visitors \n  \n  \n    1_Bartomeus \n    Sampling_year \n    2015 \n  \n  \n    1_Bartomeus \n    Country \n    Spain \n  \n  \n    1_Bartomeus \n    Habitat \n    Mediterranean shrubland \n  \n  \n    1_Bartomeus \n    Sampling_sites \n    12 \n  \n  \n    1_Bartomeus \n    Sampling_rounds \n    6 \n  \n  \n    1_Bartomeus \n    Sampling_method \n    Focal observations \n  \n  \n    1_Bartomeus \n    Total_plant_species \n    9 \n  \n  \n    1_Bartomeus \n    Total_pollinator_species \n    26 \n  \n  \n    1_Bartomeus \n    Floral_counts \n    Yes \n  \n  \n    2_Petanidou \n    Doi \n    NA \n  \n  \n    2_Petanidou \n    Dataset_description \n    This dataset documents 6 different sites in Chios Island\nGreece. The purpose of the samplings was to study post-fire succession\nof plant-pollinator system so we have included data from two sites that\nthey were burnt three years before sampling. The remaining four sites\nare unburnt scrublands with two of them being in the margins of cultivations\n(olive grove and mastic trees). Each year 3 visits to each site\nwere performed and in each visit we measured both plant-pollinator\ninteractions and flower abundance. All samplings were performed during\nthe period that most pollinators are active and most plants are flowering\n(April – End of June).

For COVID reasons, the sites were visited only from\nMay to September, 3 to 5 visits to each site were performed.

In order to sample\npollinators at the landscape scale, we placed a grid of 600 m x 600 m on each landscape.\nEach grid was then divided into 36 cells of 100 m x 100 m each, which constituted our\nsampling sites. At each site, each plant species was sampled for 40 minutes, so the\ntime spent at each site depended on the number of flowering plant species.\nWe sampled plant–pollinator interactions between June and August 2020,\nrepeating the survey four times at each site.

Coordinates are the centroids of each landscape.\nTransects were stratified in relation with the area of each type of pollinator habitat\nwithin a 500 m radius around the centroid. Habitat is given for each individual catch,\nnot for the landscape as a whole. Transect length and duration are therefore pooled in\nthis file, rather than giving the sampling time in each habitat\n(in total: 120 min per site visit, so 360 min in total, if the networks are pooled\nover the 3 sampling periods).

One plot was subjected to pollinator reduction\ntreatment and is not included here. The control plot is completely open and it is the data\nfrom those plots that are inlcuded here. Three to four visits to each site were performed,\nand in each visit we measured both plant-pollinator interactions and flower abundance. \nEach visit contained a period of 15 minutes where flower visitors were caught for\nspecies-level identification. It is this data that is being contributed here, including the \nobservations of insects that were not caught (unintentionally or because identification in the\nfield was possible). All floral visitors are included. Two years of data are available\n(3 visits in 2020 and 4 in 2021). A data paper and several manuscripts are in preparation\nwhere this data is used.

In each\n  landscape, wild bees and syrphids were sampled along\n  transects in flowering habitat types (habitat type\n  categories according to EUNIS habitat types, aggregation 2 level).\n  A 1 km transect (2 m wide) was divided into sections proportional\n  to the amount of these different flowering habitat types\n  in the core (500 m radius) of a landscape (= different\n  focal habitats within each site; stratified random sampling).\n  We placed these tansect sections randomly in different patches\n  of the corresponding habitat types in each landscape\n  (including flowering crops). Three sampling rounds\n  in April, May/June and July were conducted in each landscape,\n  adjusting the location and length of transects in each round\n  according to the proportion and location of flowering habitats.\n  The transect walks were standardized so that 3 min were used for\n  recording flower visiting bees and syrphids and their visited\n  flower for each 25 m sub-section, pausing the clock for catching\n  and processing the samples. \n  \n  \n    38_Maurer \n    Taxa_recorded \n    Flower visiting bees and syrphidae \n  \n  \n    38_Maurer \n    Sampling_year \n    2020 \n  \n  \n    38_Maurer \n    Country \n    Switzerland \n  \n  \n    38_Maurer \n    Habitat \n    Gradient from urban to agricultural landscapes \n  \n  \n    38_Maurer \n    Sampling_sites \n    12 \n  \n  \n    38_Maurer \n    Sampling_rounds \n    3 \n  \n  \n    38_Maurer \n    Sampling_method \n    Transects \n  \n  \n    38_Maurer \n    Total_plant_species \n    191 \n  \n  \n    38_Maurer \n    Total_pollinator_species \n    150 \n  \n  \n    38_Maurer \n    Floral_counts \n    Yes"

This is a task that forms part of the ongoing European project Safeguarding European wild pollinators (Safeguard). At the moment, this metaweb comprises 38 different studies distributed across 13 countries with a total of 1152 individual study sites or networks (Figure 1).\n\nObjective\nThe main goal of this metaweb is to be a dynamic, open and reproducible project that describes at the European level plant-pollinator interactions. The addition of new studies would help to improve predictions and validate the robustness of our understanding of these interactions at the continent scale. The metaweb focus only on the most relevant and representative entomophilous taxa found across networks: bees, syrphids, bombylids, butterflies and pollinating beetles.\n\n\nStatus\nThe metaweb in its current form has obvious biases (e.g., spatial) that we hope to overcome with the addition of new studies. Currently, we are in the process of reviewing and homogenising all pollinator and plant species names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.
